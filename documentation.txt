Can't abandon :hover for small screens. What if your screen is actually desktop but the window is resized?
User role is not centered vertically?

< 480px: 
16px margin-left
3 levels
icons

>= 480px
32px margin-left
3 levels
380px min width of one level

100vw - 32 - 34*(n-1) >= 380

< 480px:




On mobile, reply form goes at the bottom

On desktop, no

Both autofocus

I am finally getting to do something.

July 7, 2022
Font-sizes now in rem.

Comment trigger is reddit-like or twitter-like.


Mobile:
Opens full thread + main post floating above.

Comment form shows up at bottom. Can be triggered by Comment button. Can be hidden.

Desktop:
Opens thread under.
Comment form already exists at bottom. Autofocused by Comment button.
Thread can be hidden.


+ Option to open in new window.

Check the syntax of flex-end or end only.

make the votes 24px height on replies

Posts, comments, threads, structure is done, I think? What more?


July 13, 2022
just test the viewport height

at least 520px height

at least 600px width

Where to pick it up
Messages micro-structure.

Messages and other nav buttons floating windows macro-structure (sizing based on vw)

July 16, 2022
My screen is 1280px x 720px

The effective height is 613px

There is 77px for header.

Let's say a 992px laptop. The height is 558px.

Effective height is 451px.

Message pane and notifs pane has 374px left for height

I created the problem of rem and px. Okay don't bother about zooming users for a while.

Where to pick it up?
Messages classes. How to "unfloat"
Micro-layout of messages.

July 17, 2022
Where to pick it up? Unfloating in javascript.

July 18, 2022
The header buttons work nice. Where to pick it up? Building each page :)
Building micro-components.

Updates:
1. Better UI.
2. Header buttons are working.
3. Many changes with stylesheet.

Future updates:
1. Still need to add few changes to integrate my previous project to make the "posting" function to work.
2. Need to build micro-components inside "messages" and other mini-features.

Comments:
1. Took quite a long time because the stylesheet was a mess.
2. Had some side work, so I was not able to put in more time to build this.


Random thoughts:
Ways to optimize the posting. I can specify the root right away. For example, save the root of the thread as an element, then use it in querySelector as parent.querySelector() instead of document.querySelector().

July 20, 2022
Doing good with the Messages UI. Just need to finish some stuff tomorrow. Where to pick it up? Grid layout of the message.

I also learned about @media (hover: none)  and (pointer: none) and stuff to know the touch or non-touch devices.

July 21, 2022
Where to pick it up. Auto closing of floats when outside is clicked (if easy to do). Toggling inside messages, like closing a chat or minimizing etc.

July 22, 2022
I remembered minmax! Use this on post grid.

July 23, 2022
Random Q: What is preventDefault again?

New learnings: event delegation, you can use event.target then add the function. Check about bubbling stuff.
.closest() no need .parentElement or what not. 

innerText, innerHTML, textContent

Almost all buttons work properly.

Buttons I still need to take care of: back and x and inputs. Still need to do something about the recent chat.

Object-oriented programming? How to use properly

July 24, 2022
Forgot to add some note?

Forgot to add some note?
I think the last thing is about the clicking of new conversation.
Also the actvSidebar needs to be canceled when clicking new sidebar.


Some realizations about sizing.

When there is a parent and a child. You set child to block, height 100%, it may bleed outside the parent if parent has padding. If you make child grid or flex, it somehow fixes the problem :)

#contacts, #settings, #recent-convos, .srch-chat

Need to fix ids and classes


July 26, 27

July 28, 2022
Fixed some margins in posts. Some waste of time trying to make the threadline work.
Did some thinking about data structure

July 29, 2022
Too much thinking. But I also was able to accomplish some things.

Where to pick up? Duplicating comment forms. Issue of reading children posts. Extent and extra triggers.

July 30, 2022
Need to limit to three levels of comments
Need a highlight for the thread being replied to.

July 31, 2022
Things don't scroll on the body but on the #body. So it does not adjust


BUGS TO FIX:
- Need to fix color of info button
- Focusing and hovering
- Hover color of small-btn
- Proper implementation of button class names


FEATURES TO ADD:
- sorting of comments
- timestamping
- vote number control
- post font size


Where to pick it up?
- Adding new users
- "Logging in"
- Loading a conversation
- Loading messages in conversation

What I did today?
Some layout decisions:
- autofocusing of form now works better by removing the #body alias
- some fixes in css
- button changes based on media query
- log in page somehow

August 1, 2022

What I did today?
- learned some little things about Promises
- using some modularization stuff
- fixed files and stuff

What to do next? Check log from July 31 :)

August 2, 2022
OK:
- Adding new users
- "Logging in"
?end of OK

SMALL FEATURES:
- text-overflow


What has been my issue with coding?
- Doing small changes all the time. Tweaking and fixing stuff especially when there is a UI element that seems off or suddenly not looking correct. I just have to do it right away. I can't simply stop to write it down, and have a dedicated schedule for that. This goes to the next issue of lack of planning. Some days, I write at which part of the project to start my next day, but then, it's not that comprehensive at all. I end up doing the little changes all day. I need to apply Parkinson's Law to me. Yesterday , I just had to organize my JavaScript files and start to apply modularization strategies. Some other day, I just had to check my CSS too much, which brings to another issue of difficult CSS management. Not so bad, but maybe if I can be more organized with CSS, it would save me more time. I might even consider using CSS preprocessors.
