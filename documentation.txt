Font-sizes now in rem.

Comment trigger is reddit-like or twitter-like.


Mobile:
Opens full thread + main post floating above.

Comment form shows up at bottom. Can be triggered by Comment button. Can be hidden.

Desktop:
Opens thread under.
Comment form already exists at bottom. Autofocused by Comment button.
Thread can be hidden.


+ Option to open in new window.

Check the syntax of flex-end or end only.

make the votes 24px height on replies

Posts, comments, threads, structure is done, I think? What more?

My screen is 1280px x 720px

The effective height is 613px

There is 77px for header.

Let's say a 992px laptop. The height is 558px.

Effective height is 451px.

Message pane and notifs pane has 374px left for height

I created the problem of rem and px. Okay don't bother about zooming users for a while.

Where to pick it up?
Messages classes. How to "unfloat"
Micro-layout of messages.
