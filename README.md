This is an extension of my [interactive comments section project](https://micoirvin.com/projects/interactive-comments-section/). The repository for that project is [here](https://github.com/micoirvin/interactive-comments-section).

On this project, I am currently adding many features like messages, search, login, notifications. Right now, my documentation (and/or coding log) is still messy, but you can still take a look if you're interested. Please see documentation.txt file.

Soon, I will add a proper readme with feature notes, learning log, and references.

As you can see, this project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. After this project, I'll try to learn a framework :)
